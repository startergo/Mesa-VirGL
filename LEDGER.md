# Mesa-VirGL — Ledger

Current state of the 3D stack. **Volatile — update at the end of every
session.** Sibling repo: `~/VMQemuVGA` (kext; its ledger covers the transport
and the 2D accelerator surface path — a separate stack with no GL in it).
Durable rules for THIS repo live in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`; the cross-project
ground rules (negative controls, one variable per run, commit before
running) live in `~/VMQemuVGA/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and apply here too.

Rules for maintaining this file: same as the VMQemuVGA ledger — record what
the evidence supports; "verified" requires a negative control or a visual
check; never quietly drop an unexplained residual; mark inferences.

**This ledger was created 2026-08-16.** State before that date lives in
commit messages; the summary below is attributed to them and was not
re-verified at creation time.

## 2026-08-16 (entry 1) — pattern-fill diagnostic: PRE-REGISTERED, built, awaiting its run

**The artifact class under investigation (frontier):** PowerFox chrome
artifacts — same content drawn twice at different destinations. Two
hypotheses already eliminated:

1. **Guest-side buffer staleness — FALSIFIED** (commit `685ba319`,
   `SHIM_SINGLE_BUF`): render_buf and present_buf aliased so partial damage
   lands on the last presented frame by construction; artifacts persisted.
2. **`GL_UNPACK_ROW_LENGTH` units bug — FIXED** (commit `26c82b3`):
   ROW_LENGTH was reset to a hardcoded 0 instead of the app's value, and
   ALIGNMENT leaked after IOSurface uploads; both now saved/restored around
   every upload. (This class is a reminder: pixel-store state is
   context-global.)

**The instrument (designed earlier, pre-registered here, never yet run):**
env-gated `SHIM_PATTERN_FILL` — overwrite every IOSurface upload's source
IN PLACE with a test pattern before the teximage, written with the
surface's OWN stride (`bpr`) and bpp. Pattern: 8-colour checkerboard with
8-pixel blocks, `palette[((x>>3)+(y>>3))&7]`. Pure horizontal bars would be
shear-INVISIBLE (a constant-along-x stripe is shift-invariant); the
checkerboard makes a stride fault read as a staircase and a duplicate
destination as offset ghosting/moiré.

**Pre-registered outcomes (decided before the run):**
- **Bars/checkerboard appear SHEARED (staircase rows)** → stride fault
  DOWNSTREAM of the upload: something between the teximage and the host
  (Mesa's virgl unpack, the transfer, or the winsys scatter list) is
  reading a different row pitch than the surface's `bpr`. Next step:
  compare the unpack stride at each hop (glTexImage2D row-length state,
  virgl `TRANSFER_TO_HOST_3D` box, kext scatter entries).
- **Checkerboard CLEAN but DUPLICATED at different destinations** → the
  upload/display path is stride-correct; the artifact is composite
  destinations — Gecko (or the PixelHostingView swizzle path) drawing the
  same content twice at different positions. Next step: Gecko-side
  (which layer/view draws where; the empty-frame-blit skip `8775b09`
  adjacent).
- Checkerboard clean and singular (artifact gone with pattern) → the fault
  is in Gecko's CONTENT, not the path — re-examine with real content,
  pattern as overlay instead of replacement.

Cost: one build, no boot, no kext. Run: guest, PowerFox with
`SHIM_PATTERN_FILL=1` in the environment, observe chrome vs content areas.

**State at ledger creation (from commit log, tip `685ba319`, branch
`cross-10.6`; not re-verified here):** both GL dispatch routes landed
(flat-namespace `__DATA,__interpose` `fd7b7cf`; two-level substitute
`4b7c463`); killtest / stress (resize + multi-context + CGLEnable) / smoke
PASS; **Gecko UI renders via the substitute** (`9fb95e8` — PixelHostingView
swizzle, IOSurface upload, blit flip); fixes since: empty-frame blit skip
(`8775b09`), pixel-store save/restore (`26c82b3`), uncapped large-surface
upload logging (d5644dc). Presentation-era history: drawRect swizzle RED
WINDOW (`ef2f574`).

**Open questions carried:**
- The chrome-artifact class (this entry).
- Sustained frame rate / real workload performance — unmeasured.
- The substitute's full CPU copy per texture per frame (noted at
  `substitute_cgl.c:436` — correct first, optimize later).
